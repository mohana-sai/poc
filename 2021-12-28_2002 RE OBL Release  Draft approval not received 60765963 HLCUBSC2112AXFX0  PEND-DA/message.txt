Dear Customer, 
Our records show that a draft BL has been sent to your attention, however we are missing your draft approval to proceed with release.

In order to process your releases timely and correctly, please be sure all draft approvals are sent correctly to doc.usbsc@csd.hlag.com <mailto:doc.usbsc@csd.hlag.com>  and below information is included:

1)      Type of release (OBL, SWB, Release OBL at Destination, or Web Release) 
2)      For OBLs, please provide a label or account number for FedEx or UPS and the location you want them delivered 
3)      Rated or Unrated? 

Please note we must have one draft approval per BL number with clear release instructions as outlined above. Booking number MUST be included in the subject line for proper handling.

Thank you and Best Regards,
