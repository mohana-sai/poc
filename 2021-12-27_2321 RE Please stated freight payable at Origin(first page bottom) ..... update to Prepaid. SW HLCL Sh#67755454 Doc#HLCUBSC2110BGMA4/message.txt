Please stated freight payable at Origin(first page bottom) ..... update to Prepaid.

Thank you
Due to current situation of COVID-19 outbreak, carriers and transport providers throughout the supply chain are cancelling and rescheduling services, schedules are continually being adjusted, and space capacity issues are arising. This instability may affect rates, operations, schedules and access to services globally. deugro is unable to guarantee freight levels and service schedules at this time.
Please be advised that companies across the globe are subject to an increased risk of payment fraud. Please note that deugro will not be requesting a change in bank accounts. If there is an unexpected request to change bank accounts, please contact your deugro representative directly via telephone for confirmation.
